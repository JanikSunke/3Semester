## WOOOWAH?!?!? What is happening here??
## Are you telling me that we're just exposing the config files with all the real informaiton in them?
## Yes I am. I have my reasons:
### 
### 1. I want to ackknowlegde that you would never never never do this in real life/production/industrien. It is bad practice
###    We should instead use some kind of secret manager. Maybe the built-in one for gitlab, and store the secrets there.
### 
### 2. We are required to have CI/CD build our project. They cannot do this without our conifg, and we have no way to give them
###    our config files. And we cannot set any "secrets". This was not a problem in the beginning, but because they have to build it
###    we really have no choice but to give in.
### 
## So I just wanted to make it clear: Yes! This is a bad idea. - but everyone is doing. And I'm at least giving an explanation
## for why we're choosing to do something this stupid.
